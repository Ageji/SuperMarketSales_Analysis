### Data Source

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed records of sales transactions, including date, time, item codes, quantities sold, prices, discounts, and more. This data provides valuable insights into sales performance, profitability, and discount effects. By analyzing the data, the aim is to optimize sales strategies and increase overall profitability. 

### Tools
- Anaconda (Development environment and package management)
- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive data analysis)
- Pandas(Data cleaning and Analysis)
- Matplotlib $ Seaborn(Visualization)

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
- What is the total Revenue by the category of item?
-  Which items have the highest loss rate?
 - How do discounts affect total revenue?
- What is the average wholesale price for each category?
 - How have sales quantities trended over time?
 -  Which items are the most popular in terms of quantity sold?
  - What is the total quantity returned for each category?
  - what is the sales perfromance by hour of the day?
  -  What is profi tmargin per category?

### Findings
- Certain categories, such as Flower/Leaf Vegetables and Capsicum, generate significantly higher revenue than others like Solanum and Aquatic Tuberous Vegetables.
-  Categories with higher loss rates are costing the business more in wasted goods, leading to reduced profitability.
- The majority of revenue (over 95%) comes from items sold without a discount, indicating that the business is generating much more revenue when items are sold at full price.
- There is considerable variation in wholesale prices across categories, with some categories having consistently higher prices (Edible Mushrooms).
- Sales quantities generally increased over the years, with 2023 showing the highest volumes. Seasonal trends indicate higher sales towards the end of the year and dips in early months, suggesting seasonal influences on sales patterns.
-  Certain items consistently sell more than others, with wuhu green pepper  and Broccoil being among the top-selling items.
-  Categories, such as Aquatic Tuberous Vegetables, have a higher return rate compared to others.
- Sales generally increase throughout the day, with a significant drop in the late hours. Very low sales and revenue are observed in the early morning hours and late at night.  The highest sales performance occurs between 4 PM and 6 PM, where both quantity sold and revenue reach their peaks.
- Flower/Leaf Vegetables exhibit the highest profit margin at 33.43%, indicating superior efficiency in converting revenue into profit.Aquatic Tuberous Vegetables have the lowest profit margin at 25.00%, suggesting a need for cost optimization or pricing adjustments.

 ### Recommedation
 - The business should focus on high-revenue categories for growth or optimize lower-revenue categories to increase profitability.
 - Focus should be placed on reducing spoilage or handling costs for these items, potentially by improving storage conditions or supply chain efficiency.
 - The business may want to reconsider its discount strategy. While discounts can boost sales, the current impact seems minimal compared to the revenue generated without discounts. The goal should be to find a balance where discounts drive enough additional sales volume to justify the loss in price per unit sold.
 - The higher wholesale price of Edible Mushrooms suggests they are more valuable or costly to source compared to other categories. The low price of Flower/Leaf Vegetables indicates that they might be cheaper to produce or easier to acquire in bulk. Understanding these price differences can help optimize purchasing decisions and profit margins for each category.
 - Understanding seasonal and yearly trends can help in planning marketing and sales strategies. For example, preparing for higher sales in the last quarter of the year and addressing low sales periods at the beginning of the year can optimize revenue.The trend analysis can aid in better inventory management, ensuring stock levels are aligned with anticipated sales peaks and troughs.
 - The business should continue to promote and focus on these high-demand products, while also exploring reasons why less popular items are underperforming.
 - Products with high return rates may indicate quality issues or misalignment with customer expectations. Steps should be taken to investigate the reasons behind these returns and implement improvements in quality control.
 -  Calculate inventory turnover rates for different hours and adjust stock levels to ensure availability during peak sales periods and minimize excess inventory during low performance hours.
- Flower/Leaf Vegetables and Capsicum have the highest profit margins. It would be beneficial to focus on these categories, optimizing marketing strategies and increasing their availability to maximize profitability. Aquatic Tuberous Vegetables has the lowest profit margin. Analyze the factors contributing to the lower margin, such as high production costs or low selling prices. Consider strategies to reduce costs, negotiate better pricing with suppliers, or explore ways to add value to these products to improve margins.
